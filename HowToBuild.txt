1. Generate .sln files with "cmake -G "Visual Studio 17 2022" -A x64" or "cmake -G "Visual Studio 17 2022" -A x86"

2. You won't be able to build generated solution. Some projects will give compile errors. Change Windows SDK version of the project that you can't build to lower version. I can build with Version 10.0.15063.0
